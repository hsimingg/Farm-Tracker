Sustainable Agriculture Tracker

SDG 2 - Zero Hunger
SDG 6 - Clean Water
SDG 15 - Life on Land

Real-World Issue
- tracks the progress and status of the farm
- accessible tools to optimize crop yield while minimizing use of resources 
- maintaining a healthy crop environment

Tracker
- farm profiles with basic encryption
- view, edit, delete planting records
- sort records by yield or crop name
- search by crop type
    - food crops
    - feed crops
- help farmers input:   
    - crops types
    - water requirements and water quality
    - expected yield of optimal planting schedules
- calculates average water use and yield per crop
- tracks irrigation and resource usage
- weather & climate information
- tracking stock resources & inventory
    - fertilizer
    - seeds, etc
- recommends Sustainable methods and farming practices (based on environmental data)

- export logs via File I/O 
- test data simulation for validation
- text-based UI
- STRUCTS: crops, fields, irrigation data
    - must consist char[], int, float
- 2D ARRAYS: store water usage and yield status
- File handling: logs and encrypted user credentials
- basic encyption: caesar ciper or XOR
- Pass-by-reference for memory efficient manipulation
